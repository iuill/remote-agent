# Release Note Guideline

This guideline is for agents reviewing and rewriting GitHub Release notes for remote-agent.

## Background

Release notes are initially generated automatically from commit logs. Treat them as a draft, not as the final source of truth.

Because they come from commits:

- Conventional Commit types such as `feat`, `fix`, and `perf` may not match the actual user-facing release-note category.
- Internal implementation details may be included even when they are not useful to remote-agent users.
- Commit-message phrasing may be too terse, too technical, or written from a developer workflow perspective.
- Intermediate commits may appear as fixes even though the feature they fix has never been released before.

## Review Perspective

Review the draft from the perspective of the released remote-agent software, not from the perspective of the repository commit history.

Ask:

- What changed for users or operators of remote-agent?
- Is this an actual product feature, bug fix, performance improvement, or maintenance-only change?
- Would this entry help someone decide whether to upgrade or understand what changed?

## Categorization Rules

### Features

Use `Features` for new or expanded remote-agent capabilities visible to users, operators, or API consumers.

Do not classify development workflow improvements as product features. For example, adding lefthook-based commit checks may be a `feat` commit, but it is not a remote-agent software feature and usually should not appear in release notes.

### Fixes

Use `Fixes` for bugs that existed in a previously released version and are now corrected.

Be careful with fix commits that only repair a feature introduced earlier in the same unreleased cycle. If the broken state was never released to users, do not list it as a bug fix. Instead:

- merge it into the related feature entry, or
- omit it if it is only an implementation correction.

Do not list CI fixes, release automation fixes, test fixes, lint fixes, or development-tool fixes as product bug fixes unless they directly affect the published package or user-visible behavior.

### Performance

Use `Performance` only for changes that improve runtime behavior, responsiveness, resource usage, or scalability of remote-agent.

Do not use it for build-time, CI-time, or developer-tool performance unless that is relevant to users of the published software.

### Maintenance / Internal Changes

Most internal changes should be omitted from release notes, including:

- CI changes
- test-only updates
- lint/format/tooling configuration
- refactors with no user-visible impact
- release automation changes
- dependency updates with no notable user-facing impact
- documentation-only changes that do not change product behavior

Include such changes only when they are important for users, operators, or package consumers to know.

## Rewriting Rules

The generated draft uses commit-message text. Rewrite entries into release-note prose.

Good release-note entries should be:

- user-facing or operator-facing
- concise but understandable
- written in past tense or neutral descriptive style
- free of commit-message prefixes, implementation noise, and unnecessary scopes
- grouped under the category that best reflects the released product behavior

Avoid:

- raw commit-message phrasing such as “add x”, “fix y”, or “refactor z” when it reads like a developer task
- mentioning commit hashes or authors unless intentionally preserving generated metadata
- exposing temporary bugs that were introduced and fixed before the release
- listing every small internal commit separately

## Suggested Review Workflow

1. Read the generated release note draft.
2. Inspect the commit list between the previous tag and the new tag when needed:

```bash
git log --oneline vPREVIOUS..vNEXT
```

3. Identify entries that should be:
   - kept as-is
   - rewritten
   - moved to another category
   - merged with another entry
   - removed entirely
4. Produce a concrete review report before editing.
5. Rewrite the release notes based on that report.

For a second-pass review, use the current environment's collaboration or subagent capability when
available. Ask the reviewer to read this guideline, inspect the draft at its Release URL, and report
concrete improvements without editing files or the GitHub Release. If no such capability is
available, perform the same review as a separate local pass.

## Final Shape

A typical release note should look like:

```markdown
## Highlights

- Summarize the most important user-facing changes.

## Changes

### Features

- Describe product capabilities added or expanded.

### Fixes

- Describe user-visible bugs fixed from previous releases.

### Performance

- Describe runtime performance improvements.

Omit empty sections.
