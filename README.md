`remote-agent` is a tool for remotely operating coding agents such as Codex, Claude Code, Cursor CLI, and other agent CLIs from a single web interface. Run the `remote-agent` server on your own machine, then connect from a client device such as iOS, Android, another desktop browser, or an installed PWA to start sessions, resume work, approve tool requests, and interact with your agents.

## Requirements

- Node.js v24 and pnpm on the server machine.
- The agent account/CLI you want to use must be authenticated on the server machine as that agent normally requires. Built-in ACP adapter packages are bundled with `remote-agent`.

## Installation

This fork is not published to npm. Clone and build it before running the commands below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iuill/remote-agent.git
cd remote-agent
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### Quick Start: PWA with Tailscale(Recommended)

`remote-agent` works best when installed as a PWA from a secure Tailscale URL. PWA installation is strongly recommended for notifications and the mobile experience. To install and use the PWA, the client must access `remote-agent` through HTTPS.

Start `remote-agent` with the Tailscale setup helper:

```bash
node dist/cli.mjs serve --tailscale --port 48989
```

This command starts the `remote-agent` SPA/PWA and API server on port `48989`, configures Tailscale Serve for `https://<magic-dns-name>:48989`, then prints the URL and a QR code.

Tailscale Serve may need to update HTTPS certificate settings. If the command asks for your sudo password, enter it to continue. After setup completes, open the printed URL or scan the QR code from the client device, then install the PWA from the browser.

### QuickStart: Same-LAN Mobile Setup

For quick access from a phone or tablet on the same Wi-Fi/LAN without Tailscale, use Same-LAN mode:

```bash
node dist/cli.mjs serve --same-lan --port 4445
```

Same-LAN mode listens on `0.0.0.0`, generates a local CA and HTTPS certificate, advertises a `.local` HTTPS URL on the LAN, and prints a QR code for the mobile setup page. The setup page first opens over HTTP on the private IP so the phone can download the CA certificate, then guides you to trust it and open the HTTPS/PWA-capable URL.

Same-LAN is intended for trusted private networks only. Do not use it on public or untrusted Wi-Fi unless you understand the risk. `--same-lan` and `--tailscale` are mutually exclusive.

### Manual Setup

The `serve` command starts both the client SPA/PWA and the API server:

```bash
node dist/cli.mjs serve
```

By default, the server listens on HTTP. If you do not use `--tailscale`, you are responsible for providing secure communication between the client and the server. This can be a local setwork, a VPN, a reverse proxy, or a tunnel such as Cloudflare Tunnel in front of the local `remote-agent` server.

Running `remote-agent` on a public hostname is not the recommended default. If you do expose it, set an API key and only share the URL with trusted users. You can generate an API key with:

```bash
node dist/cli.mjs generate-api-key
```

Then pass it to the server:

```bash
RA_API_KEY='<generated-api-key>' RA_ALLOWED_IPS='x.x.x.x,y.y.y.y' node dist/cli.mjs serve
```

Then clients must send the API key as a bearer token for `/api/*` requests. You can also restrict accepted client IPs with `RA_ALLOWED_IPS`.

## Features

- 🤖 Multi-provider support: built-in providers for Codex, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI,
  pi-coding-agent, Cursor CLI, and OpenCode. Any ACP-compatible agent can also be added as a custom
  provider.
- 🌐 Browser/PWA client: the client is served as an SPA and works through a browser on any OS.
  Install it as a PWA for an app-like experience.
- ⚡ Real-time preview: stream agent output as it is produced.
- 🛠️ Visual tool viewers: inspect common tool calls such as Bash, Read, Write, and Edit with
  terminal, file, and diff viewers.
- ✅ Tool approval: approve or reject tool-approval requests from supported agents.
- 🧱 Sandboxed execution: optionally run agent CLIs through `srt` sandboxing with global,
  project-level, and per-session controls.
- 🔔 Notifications: receive task-completion and approval-request notifications. When installed as a
  PWA, device notifications are available through the service worker.
- 🔊 Completion sound: play an audible notification when an agent task finishes.
- ✍️ Efficient prompt input: use agent command completion, file-path completion, voice input, and
  image attachments.
- 🎚️ Model and mode controls: switch supported providers' model/mode from the UI, remember the last
  used choices per project/provider, and pin favorite models.
- 🧑‍💻 Code review: open a GitHub-like diff viewer, leave line comments, and seamlessly turn them
  into review instructions for the agent.
- 🌿 Git worktree support: start sessions in a selected worktree. Supports `.worktreeinclude`,
  optional setup scripts, and preserving subpaths when starting from a subdirectory in a monorepo.
- ⏰ Routines: run agents on cron schedules or at a specified datetime.
- 🔐 Authentication: supports API key authentication and IP address restrictions.

## Configuration

`remote-agent` is configured with CLI flags and environment variables.

| Environment variable | CLI flag               | Default | Description                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`               | `--port`               | `8989`  | HTTP port for the `remote-agent` server.                                    |
| `RA_DIR`             | `--ra-dir`             | `~/.ra` | Directory for the SQLite database and app state.                            |
| `RA_API_KEY`         | `--ra-api-key`         | -       | Bearer token required for `/api/*` requests. If unset, API key auth is off. |
| `RA_ALLOWED_IPS`     | `--ra-allowed-ips`     | -       | Comma-separated IP allowlist checked via `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP`.   |
| `RA_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `--ra-allowed-origins` | -       | Comma-separated CORS origin allowlist for `/api/*` requests.                |
| -                    | `--server-only`        | `false` | Start only the API server without serving the client build.                 |
| -                    | `--same-lan`           | -       | Serve HTTP/HTTPS on one LAN port and print a mobile certificate setup QR.   |
| -                    | `--tailscale`          | -       | Publish through Tailscale Serve. Use `--port` for the HTTPS port.           |

When both an environment variable and a CLI flag are provided, the CLI flag takes priority.

## Available Providers

`remote-agent` includes built-in provider presets for these agent CLIs:

| Provider           | Preset ID         | Log import |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ---------- |
| Codex              | `codex`           | ✅         |
| Claude Code        | `claude-code`     | ✅         |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `copilot-cli`     | ❌         |
| pi-coding-agent    | `pi-coding-agent` | ✅         |
| Cursor CLI         | `cursor-cli`      | ❌         |
| OpenCode           | `opencode`        | ❌         |

`remote-agent` does not require you to install built-in ACP adapter packages separately. Make sure the agent account or underlying CLI credentials you want to use are available on the server machine and authenticated as that agent normally requires.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use Claude Code through `remote-agent` with a Claude subscription account. `remote-agent`
> only connects to a local CLI process, so it may technically work with subscription-based Claude
> Code authentication. However, Claude Code ACP is implemented through Agent SDK, and Anthropic does
> not allow Claude Code subscription access to be used from third-party tools. Use provider
> authentication only when it is permitted by the provider's current terms.

### Custom Provider

Want to use another agent? Add it as a Custom Provider through ACP.

See the ACP agent list at https://agentclientprotocol.com/get-started/agents to find an available
agent. If the agent you want is not listed, implement an ACP-compatible agent server and register
its command as a Custom Provider.

## Sandboxed Agent Execution

`remote-agent` can launch agent CLIs through `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime` (`srt`) so agent
processes run with explicit filesystem and network rules.

Sandboxing is opt-in and has three layers:

1. **Global Settings → Sandbox**: choose which provider presets are allowed to use sandboxing and
   define global filesystem/network rules.
2. **Project Settings → Sandbox**: enable sandboxing by default for that project and add project
   rules. Relative paths are resolved from the session working directory.
3. **New session toolbar**: toggle sandboxing for an individual session before it starts.

Filesystem rules support read/write allowlists and denylists. Network policy can be unrestricted
(`none`) or restricted to an allowlist of domains. Project network policy can inherit the global
policy, override it with its own restricted allowlist, or disable network restriction for that
project.

For agent runtime files, `remote-agent` automatically grants read access to common local agent
configuration directories such as `~/.codex`, `~/.pi`, `~/.claude`, `~/.github`, and `~/.copilot`.
Provider-specific writable runtime directories are added where needed, such as `~/.codex` for Codex
and `~/.pi` for pi-coding-agent. The default write allowlist includes the session working directory
(`.`).

Sandboxing is a defense-in-depth feature, not a replacement for normal security controls. Keep using
private networks, API key authentication, IP restrictions, and trusted agent credentials.

## How It Works

`remote-agent` keeps ACP sessions on the Node.js server instead of starting local agents directly from the browser. The browser SPA talks to the Hono API/BFF, the server manages ACP-compatible provider processes, and agent output, plans, diffs, terminal data, and approval requests are streamed back to the browser.

## Security

`remote-agent` is designed to run on trusted machines and private networks, and its dependency policy is intentionally conservative:

- pnpm `minimumReleaseAge` is enabled so newly published package versions are not installed immediately.
- Every release must pass `pnpm audit --audit-level low` before publishing.
- Runtime dependencies are kept at zero except for ACP packages that must be available directly at runtime for the built-in agent providers.
